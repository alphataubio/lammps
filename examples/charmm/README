Example simulations for CHARMM force field
==========================================

* cmap:       CMAP 5-body contributions to CHARMM force field

* charmmfsw:  minimal PDB example (1HVN) with at least one protein and one ssDNA, solvated in TIP3 water, also demonstrates read_psf and write_psf commands.

* peptide:    dynamics of a small solvated peptide chain (5-mer)
